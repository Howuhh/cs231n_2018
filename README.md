solutions for 2018 course assignments

## Assignment 1: DONE

In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
- understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
- develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy
- implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
- implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- implement and apply a Softmax classifier
- implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier
- understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
- get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)

## Assignment 2
In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures  
- understand and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation  
- implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks  
- implement batch normalization for training deep networks  
- implement dropout to regularize networks  
- effectively cross-validate and find the best hyperparameters for Neural Network architecture  
- understand the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and train gain experience with training these models on data
